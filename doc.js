// ETL: Extract, Transform, Load
// To convert large amounts of data
// from one format to another

// When we need to use ETL pipline?
// Goal: To solve the problem of having data in
// disparate places and formats
// by pulling the data from various sources
// into a centralized location with a standardized format.

// Pipeline: The set of processes that allow
// data to flow from one destination to another.

// All ETL processes have in common is that
// 1.) They take data from one or more locations
// 2.) They modify and standardize the taken data.
// 3.) They load the data to another destination to
// be used in its new format.

// Async/Await: to write asynchronous code in a way
// that reads like synchronous code.

// What the async/await function modifiers do?
// How to use async/await with Promises

// Promises: it makes writing asynchronous (non-blocking) code easier
// How promises are used and why

// Scenario
// Execute multiple asynchronous operations concurrently,
// wait for them all to complete,
// and then do something with the combined result.
// --> Promise.all --> to simultaneously execute multiple asynchronous operations.

// ETL
// the process of collecting the data from a specific source
// convert it into the required format
// and load it to the destination database
